trump-to-duck
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'Trump' with 'Duck'. Forked from Steve Frank's [CloudToButt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt).

I'm fed up with reading news articles about Donald Trump. But they're hard to avoid, so if I have to see them, then I might as well make them more amusing.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag TrumpToDuck.crx into the page that appears.
